\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank both of my thesis advisors Prof. Darren Strash and Prof. Aaron Gember-Jacobson. The former had an incredibly involved role throughout my independent study and development of my thesis. I would not have been able to complete this thesis without his organization, incredible experience, and mentorship. I cannot stress enough how lucky I am to have him acting as the chief advisor of my thesis. I have had the privilege of being advised by Prof. Gember-Jacobson for both this thesis and as my computer science advisor. Both have taught me in the classroom and have had profound impact on my experience and enjoyment as a computer science major as well as giving industry guidance for my pursuits after Colgate. I also would like to thank Prof. Will Cipoli. He provided valuable consultation related to machine learning algorithms and feedback on my various models implemented for my Twitter sentiment trading contributions. I would additionally like to thank my parents, friends, and family for allowing me to complete this thesis.
